A beginner-friendly collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources to help you master **scikit-learn**—the most accessible, powerful Python library for machine learning.

##  Why This Repository Matters
- **Learn by doing** — Dive into concise, walk-through notebooks that take you from zero to scikit-learn essentials.
- **Clear explanations, minimal jargon** — We emphasize *what you can achieve* rather than complex implementation details.
- **Build real-world intuition** — Cover tasks like classification, regression, clustering, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

##  Quick Start
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AS200585/Scikit-Learn.git
````

2. **Optional: create environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````
3. **Run a sample notebook**
   Start Jupyter Notebook or Lab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `01_simple_classification.ipynb` to train and test a classifier in under 10 lines of code.

## Example: Train & Test a Classifier

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, random_state=42)

clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = clf.predict(X_test)

print(f"Test set accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, preds):.2f}")
```
